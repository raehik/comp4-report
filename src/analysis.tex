\section{Analysis}

\subsection{Problem identification}

\note{I need this b/c it gives details about my client}
Amartya is a Sixth Form student at Reading School taking 4 A-levels plus an EPQ.
Year 13 is an especially important year for students aiming at university:
pupils' results greatly influence their options following compulsory education.
Classes often don't set firm homework or deadlines, as teachers expect students
to make suitable time for studying at home themselves depending on how confident
they feel with the material.

The support given by the school on organising or prioritising is very limited,
except about revision techniques during examination season. A degree of
organisation can help immensely with A-level studies, especially when we have to
find work to do ourselves. Calendars and other such tools can help with
day-to-day life too. Amartya has told me that he has trouble keeping track of
work and to-dos, and explained that his current methods for organising projects
and appointments are messy.

My project aims to improve Amartya's organisation skills by \textbf{making it
easier} to keep track of events, appointments and to-dos at various levels of
detail including monthly, daily, and hourly, and by reminding the user about
chosen appointments or to-dos.


\subsection{Current system}

Amartya uses post-it notes for both short-term tasks (such as remembering to
feed the rabbits before night) and long-term things (e.g. deadlines or project
milestones). This simple system works well for short to-do lists or people with
messy desks, since the notes won't get lost under paper. I identified a number
of problems, however:

\begin{itemize}
  \item There is always the concern that a post-it could get buried or fall
        from the wall, meaning a task could be completely forgotten about.
        Also, post-it notes don't provide much space to write on, so it isn't
        always possible to provide extra detail on a longer task; or you have to
        use multiple notes, which requires that they all stay together.
  \item Post-it notes lose adhesiveness over time, so the system would be a pain
        to maintain. This means it \textit{discourages long-term notes} because
        using notes for more than 2-3 weeks makes it more time-consuming to
        re-affix the old ones.
  \item It can be hard to remember where certain post-its are, or you could
        accidentally place one post-it over another and forget about the one
        underneath.
  \item The system doesn't show you what you need to do now or soon -- you have
        to search through the post-it notes and decide for yourself. This could
        also mean you have to 'remember' which projects you need to work on,
        which is what an organising system should do for you.
\end{itemize}

Overall, using only post-its makes a hard-to-use and rudimentary system. My new
system plans to replace the post-it system by with a more complete organiser:
providing advanced features such as calendar functions, to-do creation, and
timeline views with physical printouts.


\subsection{Potential users}

My main client for this project is Amartya. I am planning to develop the
software around Amartya's specifications and requirements, but this could
expand to myself and other students at my school. Given more time to polish the
software, I may also be able to sell it as an organiser package - however that
would be a later extension to the project.


\subsection{Requirements and limitations}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The software must store data in a database reliably, so data corruption
      does not occur.
  \item The user must be able to create appointments (descriptive events with a
      possible associated time and location) and to-dos (simple text e.g. a
      single bullet point).
  \item The software must allow searching using keywords.
  \item The software must allow searching for appointments within a range of
      days.
  \item The software must be able to show a summary of appointments in a year
      calendar view, a month view, and a day view.
  \item The software must have an option to create desktop alerts for
      appointments, which must trigger at user-defined time.
  \item The software's menus should be straightforward and easy to move through.
  \item The software could have 'family sharing', so that authorised users can
      view another person's calendar.
  \item The software could make a printable copy of the different views.
  \end{itemize}


\subsection{Data sources and destinations}

In the current system the user who is organising themselves makes post-it notes.
There is also the option for someone else to write a note and leave it on their
desk. The new system will stay the same in that the only source is the user
owning the calendar (or other people with access to the computer with the
calendar on).

The entered to-dos or appointments will be stored in a database (in separate
tables) and will be able to be viewed on the calendar views. Notifications will
store a time and a pointer to the appointment they notify about.


\subsection{Data volumes}

Only textual data will be stored: times, descriptions etc. are all
non-binary. Data for a single calendar such as appointments and to-dos will be
stored in a single database.

Each calendar is intended to be accessed and edited by a single user. If a
'family sharing' feature is implemented, other users would be able to view
another user's calendar (but not edit it).

The system can have any number of calendars available. Only one calendar can be
loaded at any time and each calendar is stored in a separate database. I am
making this system expecting that it will be used by a family -- therefore at
most there will be 10 users using the system concurrently.

Users may access the system up to a few times every hour. The software may be
left running in the background while a computer is on for notifications. Thus
the software should not be resource-intensive while the user is not using it.

\subsection{Object analysis diagram}

What the hell is this? Big TODO.

\subsection{Objectives}

\todo{Numbered! Maybe?}

e.g. The user must be able to:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Create new appointments
  \item Edit pre-existing appointments
  \item Remove appointments (including both finished ones and ones not yet passed)
  \item View appointments in a number of ways:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item View appointments for a chosen day by hour
      \item View appointments for a chosen week (past or future)
      \item View appointments for a chosen month
      \item View appointments for a chosen year
      \end{enumerate}
  \item Print any of the calendar views described above
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Potential solutions}

\note{I am NOT ALLOWED physical systems here!!! They have to be computer-based
solutions.}

\subsubsection{Pre-existing digital solution}

There are a number of existing digital calendars available for varying
platforms. A stand-out contender is Google Calendar

\subsubsection{Excel spreadsheet}

Excel spreadsheets are a simple way to record data in a structured way so that
it can easily be understood. As well, macros give spreadsheets much more
flexibility, since complex functions can be created to speed up certain
operations.

TODO

\subsubsection{Desktop application}

\begin{itemize}
  \item + The software could be used offline.
  \item + Data operations are almost always faster than querying data on a
          remote server.
  \item + I wouldn't have to pay for or administrate a server.
  \item - I would have to compile the software for both Windows and Linux.
\end{itemize}

\todo{More pluses!}


\subsubsection{Web application}

\begin{itemize}
  \item + It would be easy to make it compatible with all major operating
          systems.
  \item + It would be simple to implement mobile support.
  \item + Graphical interfaces are simple to create.
  \item - Some tasks may be harder to perform -- e.g. printing, event alerts
  \item - I would be competing with many other web-based calendars.
  \item - I would need to spend time learning how to use the various tools in
          the web development stack.
\end{itemize}

There are also a number of potential paper-based systems. Year calendars are a
very common tool used to track important appointments over a year. For a more structured system,
you could use smaller calendars for months, or keep a sheet for writing down
appointments for the coming week. To-dos are relatively simple:
