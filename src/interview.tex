\subsection{Initial interview}

I conducted an interview over email with Amartya while writing requirements for
the project. A formatted version of the original text follows (sensitive
information has been removed):

\newcommand{\qu}[1]{\item\textit{Q: #1 \\}}
\newcommand{\ans}[1]{A: #1}

\begin{itemize}
\qu{Question?}
\ans{Answer.}

\qu{Question?}
\ans{Answer.}
\end{itemize}
