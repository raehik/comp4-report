Notes on the COMP4 report
=========================

Report documents
----------------

Our reports are expected to be pretty comprehensive; yet it's not preferred to
place giant tables of statistics between important paragraphs, since you want it
to be as easily readable as possible. To that end, we have been given a likely
report document structure:

  1. The **main report** in one document, including appendices for full
     interview texts and such things which you may want to keep for evidence,
     but aren't integral to the report.
  2. A separate document for the **project documentation**. This means Javadoc
     output for the Java peeps, and some other documentation generation tool for
     ones using another language. I'm using C++, so I'm going with
     [**Doxygen**][doxygen].
  3. Another document containing **code listings** for the entire project (with
     **line numbers**).
