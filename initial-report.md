Initial report
==============

Topic
-----

I want to create a flexible calendar/organiser which is easy to use.


Complexity
----------

 * I will be using SQLite to store events. One event object
   stores at least a date, description and detail field.
 * I will be using OOP.
 * I will be using regex for keyword searching.
 * I may make an export-to-PDF function (for printing).

I'd like to include either of the 'Communication protocols' or
'Non-trivial algorithms' points, but I'm not sure it would be easy if
even possible.


Client
------

Joe H. is my client. To keep track of things, he sticks post-its over
walls in his room, but told me that it's not a great system since it can
be hard to find certain post-its and when you've got so many littering
the walls, the system breaks down.


Software/hardware needed
------------------------

I will be developing the software primarily for Windows **and**
Linux. Mac may be a given since I'm targeting Linux. The software should
run on any old PC. I will need SQLite and possibly some external
libraries (depending on the language I decide on).


Chosen language
---------------

I'm deciding between C++ and Java for language choice. I can't think of
any advantages for Java except for that I won't have to work on project
layout myself (Eclipse will do that). If I use C++, I'll have to keep my
project organised myself, and I know that C++ can be challenging when
you're dealing with lots of classes.

Python is out because of the numerous niggles it comes with, including a
shaky OOP implementation and painful importing.

I'm very likely going to go with C++, since even though I'd have to
adapt to not using an IDE, that's kind of what I want to do.
